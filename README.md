# Learn programming yourself

This mini-project is purely educational and aims to provide some help for people willing to learn programming. As such, it enables user to write simple programs in Lua, IMO the easiest programming language.

# What does it do?

Two things:
1. Provides terminal-like interface for writing scripts
2. Visualizes existing variables in another window, enabling user to change them either by hand or via code

# Build

1. Download `lua interpreter` and make it visible to cargo.
2. Drop into 'images/' folder any image with name "den-programmista.jpg"
3. Run 'cargo build' command

# Images issue

If you want to change name of the image needed to run program, change global variable 'BACKGROUND_IMAGE_NAME' in `src/main.rs`
